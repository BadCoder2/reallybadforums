<p>Introducing: Super Bad Forums</p>
<p>There are no accounts. There isn't any security, or organization (unless you make a forum post of that,) or anything. Just create a post and share the ID with people you want to see it. That's it.</p>
<h2>View A Form Post</h2>
<form method="POST" action = "/view_post">
    <div class = "form-group">
        <input type="text" name = "thing2" id="vew"></input>
    </div>
    <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="View A Post">
</form>
<p>Put random characters in the next text box for the seed of the randomness, and you will be directed to a random post. (Leave blank for auto-generated seed)</p>
<form method="POST" action = "/view_rand_post">
    <div class = "form-group">
        <input type="text" name = "seed"</input>
    </div>
    <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="View A Random Post">
</form>
<h2>Create a Forum Post</h2>
<p>(Plaintext only.) Note: newlines are banned. There is no such thing as a newline.</p>
<form method="POST" action = "/make_forum_post">
    <div class = "form-group">
        <textarea type="text" name = "thing" id="mke"></textarea>
    </div>
    <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Post Forum Thing">
</form>
